# PRODIGY_DS_TASK2
Task 2 Completed – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
I am pleased to share that I have successfully completed Task 2 of my internship at Prodigy InfoTech.
In this task, I performed an in-depth EDA on the Airbnb NYC dataset using Python libraries Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The analysis involved creating various visualizations such as histograms, bar plots, pair plots, scatter plots, pie charts, and heatmaps to uncover trends, correlations, and patterns in the data.
Key learnings from this task:
Conducting data exploration to extract actionable insights
Visualizing categorical & numerical data distributions effectively
Identifying pricing trends and availability patterns across room types
Analyzing correlation between variables (e.g., beds & price)
Enhancing plots with clear labels, colors, and legends for better readability
Key conclusions from the EDA:
 Shared rooms dominate with 55.6% contribution, while private rooms & hotel rooms have smaller shares compared to shared rooms & apartments.
 Most listings are priced between $20–$300, with $100 being the most frequent price.
 Very few listings are priced above $600; as prices increase, reviews tend to decrease.
 Hotel rooms & apartments show the highest availability for 350+ days; no hotel room bookings exist in Bronx & Staten Island.
 Manhattan leads in hotel room bookings.
 Beds and price have a positive correlation (0.4); apartments receive the highest number of reviews overall
 Private rooms under $300 have the most reviews among all room types.
I look forward to applying these insights and visualization skills to more complex analytical problems in the upcoming tasks.
